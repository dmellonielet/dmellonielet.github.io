I am so excited to introduce my weekly newsletter on Substack- [The Weekly Sync](https://theweeklysync.substack.com/).

The primary purpose of this is to practice consistency with writing, experiementing with varied topics that are best suited for short form content with a potential of becoming blog posts here and leveraging the powerful features of a platform like Substack.

A list of publications so far:

1. [Introducing 'The Weekly Sync'](https://theweeklysync.substack.com/p/introducing-the-weekly-sync)
2. [The things we have control over](https://theweeklysync.substack.com/p/the-things-we-have-control-over)
