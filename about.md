I am a Software Engineer based in the **San Francisco Bay Area**. 
As a backend engineer, my area of expertise and interest is backend engineering and security primarily focused on data modeling, designing and evolving interfaces, developing scalable APIs and services and software security.

At *Intel Corporation*, I lead the design and development of microservices that power the next generation of immersive media experiences for Sports using volumetric data.
Before Intel, I have worked at *McAfee LLC*, one of the leaders in Cyber Security where I gained depth on securing software and defense against threats.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering from San Jose State University. *Go Spartans*!

Throughout my career, I have encountered opportunities and challenges where I worked with talented people on products that are used across the globe.

Outside my regular responsibilities, I am very passionate about mentorship (often a mentee and sometimes a mentor!) and initiatives that support STEM education.

I am an avid reader, fitness fanatic and love to spend time outdoors!
  
 On this blog, I share my learnings in tech from a Senior Software Engineer's lenses.
Have ideas/ feedback you would like to talk more about? ***I am all ears***!
