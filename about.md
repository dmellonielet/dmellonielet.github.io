![Welcome!](/images/GoldenGate.jpg "Photo by Andreas Selter on Unsplash")

I am a Software Engineer based in San Francisco Bay Area. My area of expertise and interest is distributed systems as I have primarily worked on backend systems designing and developing scalable services.
At Intel Corporation, I develop microservices that power the next generation of immersive media experiences using volumetric data.
Prior to Intel, I have worked at McAfee, one of the leaders in Cyber Security where I gained depth on securing software and defense against threats.
I have a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering from San Jose State University.

Throughout my career, I have encountered opportunities and challenges where I worked with talented people.
Outside my regular responsibilites, I am very passionate about mentorship (often a mentee and sometimes a mentor!) and initiatives that support STEM education.

On this blog, I am sharing my learnings in tech from a Senior Software Engineer's lenses.
