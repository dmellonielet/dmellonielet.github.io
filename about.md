![Welcome!](/images/GoldenGate.jpg "Photo by Andreas Selter on Unsplash")

I am a Software Engineer based in sunny **California**.
I like to think of myself as a specialized generalist, having worked on various areas of software engineering- building backend systems, infrastructure, operations, and security software development.

At *Intel Corporation*, I am currently working on building the next generation of developer productivity platforms. I enjoy interacting with several development teams and influencing them towards the new initiatives.
Before Intel, I have worked at *McAfee LLC*, one of the leaders in Cyber Security where I gained depth on securing software and defense against threats.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering from San Jose State University. *Go Spartans*!
I have encountered opportunities and challenges in my career where I worked with talented people on products used across the globe.
Outside my regular responsibilities at work, I am very passionate about mentorship (often a mentee and sometimes a mentor!) and initiatives that support STEM education.

I am an avid reader, fitness fanatic and love to spend time outdoors!
My mantra- **'Be the Change you wish to see in the World'**.

On this blog, I share my learnings in tech, career development, and wellness.
Have ideas/ feedback you would like to discuss with me? ***I am all ears***!
